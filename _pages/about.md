I am a [Schmidt AI in Science Fellow](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/schmidt-ai-in-science-postdocs/) at the University of Chicago, where I am jointly mentored by [Suri Vaikuntanathan](https://chemistry.uchicago.edu/faculty/suri-vaikuntanathan-0) and [Aaron Dinner](https://chemistry.uchicago.edu/faculty/aaron-dinner). Previously, I was supported by a [Kadanoff-Rice Fellowship](https://mrsec.uchicago.edu/education/for-our-research-community/kadanoff-rice-postdoctoral-fellowships/). I am broadly interested in the physics and engineering of active soft and biological matter.

I received a Ph.D. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from Rice University in 2022, under the supervision of [Fred MacKintosh](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/frederick-c-mackintosh), and a B.S.E. in Chemical and Biological Engineering from Princeton in 2016.

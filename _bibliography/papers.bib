This boundary can be crossed either by varying the concentration or by deformation. Near the onset or loss of rigidity, dissipation-limiting nonaffine rearrangements dominate the macroscopic viscoelastic response, giving rise to diverging relaxation times and power-law rheology. Here, we derive a simple relationship between nonaffinity and excess viscosity in fluid-immersed amorphous materials. We then demonstrate this relationship and its rheological consequences in simulations of stress relaxation in strained filament networks and dense suspensions.},

	abstract = {Tissues commonly consist of cells embedded within a fibrous biopolymer network. Whereas cell-free reconstituted biopolymer networks typically soften under applied uniaxial compression, various tissues, including liver, brain, and fat, have been observed to instead stiffen when compressed. The mechanism for this compression-stiffening effect is not yet clear. Here, we demonstrate that when a material composed of stiff inclusions embedded in a fibrous network is compressed, heterogeneous rearrangement of the inclusions can induce tension within the interstitial network, leading to a macroscopic crossover from an initial bending-dominated softening regime to a stretching-dominated stiffening regime, which occurs before and independently of jamming of the inclusions. Using a coarse-grained particle-network model, we first establish a phase diagram for compression-driven, stretching-dominated stress propagation and jamming in uniaxially compressed two- and three-dimensional systems. Then, we demonstrate that a more detailed computational model of stiff inclusions in a subisostatic semiflexible fiber network exhibits quantitative agreement with the predictions of our coarse-grained model as well as qualitative agreement with experiments.},

At physiological levels of connectivity, such networks would be mechanically unstable with only central-force interactions. While networks can be stabilized by bending interactions, it has also been shown that they exhibit a critical transition from floppy to rigid as a function of applied strain. Beyond a certain strain threshold, it is predicted that underconstrained networks with only central-force interactions exhibit a discontinuity in the shear modulus. We study the finite-size scaling behavior of this transition and identify both the mechanical discontinuity and critical exponents in the thermodynamic limit. We find both non-mean-field behavior and evidence for a hyperscaling relation for the critical exponents, for which the network stiffness is analogous to the heat capacity for thermal phase transitions. Further evidence for this is also found in the self-averaging properties of fiber networks.},

The introduction of weak bending interactions stabilizes these networks and suppresses the critical signatures of this transition. We show that applying external stress can also stabilize subisostatic networks with only tensile central force interactions, i.e., a ropelike potential. Moreover, we find that the linear shear modulus shows a power-law scaling with the external normal stress, with a non-mean-field exponent. For networks with finite bending rigidity, we find that the critical stain shifts to lower values under prestress.},

Recent work has shown that this behavior can be understood in terms of the porous, two-component nature and consequent time-dependent compressibility of hydrogels. The apparent normal stress measured by a torsional rheometer reflects only the tensile contribution of the axial component σzz on long (compressible) timescales, crossing over to the first normal stress difference, N1 = σxx − σzz at short (incompressible) times. While the behavior of N1 is well understood for isotropic viscoelastic materials undergoing affine shear deformation, biopolymer networks are often anisotropic and deform nonaffinely. Here, we numerically study the normal stresses that arise under shear in subisostatic, athermal semiflexible polymer networks. We show that such systems exhibit strong deviations from affine behavior and that these anomalies are controlled by a rigidity transition as a function of strain.},

Here we present a microfluidic device to culture individual C. elegans in parallel throughout post-embryonic development. The device allows for periodic mechanical immobilization of the worm, enabling 3D imaging at subcellular precision. The immobilization is sufficient to enable fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements on organelles and other substructures within the same specific cells throughout larval development, without the use of chemical anesthetics. Using this device, we measure FRAP recovery of two nucleolar proteins in specific intestinal cells within the same worms during larval development. We show that these proteins exhibit different fluorescence recovery as the worm grows, suggesting differential protein interactions during development. We anticipate that this device will help expand the possible uses of C. elegans as a model organism, enabling its use in addressing fundamental questions at the subcellular scale.},

We study a class of minimal flocking models whose only source of irreversibility is self-propulsion and use the entropy production rate (EPR) to quantify the departure from equilibrium across their phase diagrams. The EPR is maximal in the vicinity of the order-disorder transition, where reshuffling of the interaction network is fast. We show that signatures of irreversibility come in the form of asymmetries in the steady-state distribution of the flock's microstates. These asymmetries occur as consequences of the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the considered self-propelled systems, independently of the interaction details. In the case of metric pairwise forces, they reduce to local asymmetries in the distribution of pairs of particles. This study suggests a possible use of pair asymmetries both to quantify the departure from equilibrium and to learn relevant information about aligning interaction potentials from data.},

	abstract = {The mechanical properties of tissues play a critical role in their normal and pathophysiological functions such as tissue development, aging, injury, and disease. Understanding tissue mechanics is important not only for designing realistic biomimetic materials for tissue engineering and drug testing but also for developing novel diagnostic techniques and medical interventions. Tissues are heterogeneous materials consisting of cells confined within extracellular matrices (ECMs), both of which derive their structural integrity, at least in part, from networks of biopolymers. However, the rheology of purified reconstituted biopolymer networks fails to explain many key aspects of tissue mechanics. Notably, purified networks typically soften under applied compression, whereas many soft tissues like liver, fat, and brain instead stiffen when compressed. While continuum models can readily capture this compression-stiffening behavior, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. In this perspective paper, we discuss several recently proposed microscopic mechanisms that may explain compression stiffening of soft tissues. These mechanisms include (I) interactions between the ECM and volume-preserving inclusions that promote extension-dominated stiffening of fibrous ECMs when subject to uniform compression, (II) ECM interactions with rigid inclusions under non-uniform compression, (III) other internal physical constraints that cause compression stiffening of cells and ECMs, and (IV) propagation of compressive forces through jammed, compression-stiffening cells. We further identify a few of the many open problems in understanding the structure–function relationship of soft-tissue mechanics.},

Here, we report simulations on two distinct network structures in three dimensions. By performing a finite-size scaling analysis, we test hyperscaling and identify various critical exponents. From the apparent validity of hyperscaling, as well as the non-mean-field exponents we observe, our results suggest that the upper critical dimension for the strain-controlled phase transition is above three, in contrast to the jamming transition that represents another athermal, mechanical phase transition.},

Further, we show that unlike networks of purified F-actin or microtubules, which soften in compression, vimentin intermediate filament networks stiffen in both compression and extension, and we present a theoretical model to explain this response based on the flexibility of vimentin filaments and their surface charge, which resists volume changes of the network under compression.

	title = {Phase {Transitions} in the {Rheology} of {Biopolymer} {Networks}},
	abstract = {Most biological materials are stabilized internally by disordered networks of long, thin protein assemblies known as biopolymers. These networks occupy a negligible fraction of the space inside cells and tissues, yet are largely responsible for their extraordinary mechanical properties and exceptional resilience against unpredictable physiological loads. An essential contributor to this resilience is their highly strain-dependent stiffness; they easily deform to accommodate small strains, yet resist damage by stiffening significantly in response to larger strains. Recent work has suggested that the phenomenon of strain-induced stiffening in stiff or athermal biopolymer networks, like the collagen-rich extracellular matrix, constitutes a phase transition between distinct mechanical regimes, analogous to connectivity-controlled rigidity transitions observed in networks and other amorphous materials. Simulations have shown that this transition is heralded by classic signatures of continuous phase transitions, including power law scaling of relevant observables and a diverging correlation length.
In this thesis, we develop theoretical and computational models to describe the mechanics and dynamics of disordered elastic networks near the onset of rigidity. We develop a real space renormalization-based scaling theory that establishes relationships between the various critical exponents describing the scaling of the elastic moduli and fluctuations in networks near both the strain-controlled and connectivity-controlled rigidity transitions, which we validate using simulations of coarse-grained elastic networks. We then describe the rheology of fluid-immersed networks near the strain-induced stiffening transition and demonstrate that a coupling between diverging strain fluctuations and time-dependent energy dissipation leads to emergent power law rheology at a critical prestrain. Next, we explore the effects of criticality on a phenomenon in biopolymer networks known as the nonlinear Poisson effect, which describes their tendency to shrink dramatically and strongly align when stretched, a behavior with potentially major consequences for matrix-embedded cells. We show that this effect coincides with an analogous extension-controlled rigidity transition and describe the influence of this transition on network rearrangement and the scaling of the apparent Young's modulus. We further propose a physical mechanism for the unusual compression-driven stiffening effect observed in tissues. Considering a simplified model tissue consisting of a disordered network with embedded stiff particles, we construct a phase diagram describing a unique regime of compression-driven, tension-dominated mechanical stability that arises in these systems before conventional jamming, which we validate in simulations.},
